                <h2><center>The Development Story<center></h2>
                
                <p>It was a ludum dare project that we made to help break in our artists</p>
                <p>I as the only programmer should not have gone with a randomly generated terrain</p>
                <p>After several bugs and fixes we finally released it</p>
                <p>For obvious reasons if you play it it did not do well</p>
                <p>But as part of our history we still proudly show it here</p>
                <p>It was important because it taught us how to work together</p>
                <p>Although for the future simpilier games will be amongst our project ideas for ludum dare</p>
