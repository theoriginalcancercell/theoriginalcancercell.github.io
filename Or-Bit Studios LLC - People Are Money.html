                <p>It began as another ludum dare entry</p>
                <p>This game had a very smooth development story</p>
                <p>It only had one major bug and it took only minutes to fix</p>
                <p>Its simplicity taught me to avoid disasters</p>
                <p>While such disasters would go on to teach us how to work together</p>
