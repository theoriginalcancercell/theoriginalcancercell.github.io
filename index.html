			<h1><center>What We Do</center></h1>
			<hr>
			<p><center>We are a company set on creating intriguing stories that will insite value in people's lives.</center></p>

			<p>With the above goal in mind we had to choose a medium to express our stories in.</p>
			
			<h2><center>Why We Chose Games<center></h2>
			
			<p>We wanted to tell immersive stories in an interesting fashion</p>
			<p>Games allowed us to tell players an interesting story that they can alter</p>
			<p>When players play a game they get more story out of the lore than they would from traditional mediums</p>
			<p>Also we find that making games is more of a challenge and who doesn't like a good challenge</p>
			<p>We make games not because we play them, but because we want people to hear stories.</p>
